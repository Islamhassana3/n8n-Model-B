# Deployment Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix Railway deployment issues and ensure the n8n-workflow-builder deploys correctly.

## Problem Statement

The application was failing to deploy on Railway with the error:
```
Application failed to respond
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Build Configuration Issues**
   - railway.toml had incorrect builder configuration (case-sensitive)
   - Missing nixpacks.toml configuration file
   - No explicit build instructions for Railway

2. **URL Normalization Issues**
   - N8N_HOST environment variable was not being normalized
   - Railway provides domains without protocol prefix
   - Connection to N8N was failing due to missing https://

3. **PORT Configuration Conflict (Critical Fix - Dec 2024)**
   - Documentation instructed users to set PORT=1937 manually
   - Railway automatically assigns PORT variable for routing
   - Manual PORT setting overrides Railway's automatic assignment
   - Causes "Application failed to respond" error because Railway expects app on its assigned port
   - Health checks fail because Railway checks the assigned port, not 1937

4. **Documentation Gaps**
   - No step-by-step deployment checklist
   - Environment variables not clearly documented
   - Troubleshooting steps were scattered across multiple files
   - Contradictory information about PORT variable

## Changes Made

### 1. Railway Build Configuration

#### railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"  # Changed from "nixpacks" (case matters!)

[deploy]
startCommand = "node build/main.cjs"  # Explicit start command
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3
```

#### nixpacks.toml (NEW)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm ci"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "node build/main.cjs"
```

**Why this helps:**
- Railway now knows exactly how to build the project
- Explicit phases prevent build confusion
- Health check endpoint is properly configured

### 2. URL Normalization Fix

#### src/http-server.ts & src/server.ts
Added `normalizeN8nHost()` function:

```typescript
const normalizeN8nHost = (host: string): string => {
  if (!host) return 'http://localhost:5678';
  
  // Remove trailing slash
  host = host.replace(/\/$/, '');
  
  // Add https:// if no protocol specified and not localhost
  if (!host.startsWith('http://') && !host.startsWith('https://')) {
    // Use https for production Railway deployments, http for localhost
    const isLocalhost = host.includes('localhost') || host.includes('127.0.0.1');
    host = isLocalhost ? `http://${host}` : `https://${host}`;
  }
  
  return host;
};
```

**Why this helps:**
- Automatically adds https:// prefix for Railway domains
- Handles localhost development correctly
- Removes trailing slashes that cause 404 errors
- Works with any domain format Railway provides

**Example transformations:**
- `example.up.railway.app` → `https://example.up.railway.app`
- `http://localhost:5678` → `http://localhost:5678`
- `https://custom.domain.com/` → `https://custom.domain.com`

### 3. Dockerfile Updates

#### Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Simplified and fixed
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install dependencies and build
RUN npm ci
COPY src/ ./src/
COPY scripts/ ./scripts/
COPY tsconfig.json ./
RUN npm run build

# Clean user name
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S n8nuser -u 1001  # Changed from 'nextjs' to 'n8nuser'
```

**Why this helps:**
- Clearer user naming (n8nuser instead of nextjs)
- wget is already available in node:18-alpine
- Build process is reliable

### 4. Documentation Added

#### RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (NEW)
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Service dependencies diagram
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Verification steps after deployment
- Security recommendations

#### RAILWAY_ENV_TEMPLATE.md (NEW)
- Exact environment variables for each service
- PostgreSQL and MySQL variants
- Copy-paste ready configurations
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Security best practices

#### .dockerignore Updates
- Properly exclude/include necessary files
- Exclude tests and development files
- Keep build directory excluded (built on Railway)

## Testing Performed

### Build Tests
✅ Local build successful
```bash
npm run build
# Output: Build completes without errors
```

### Unit Tests
✅ All 78 tests passing
```bash
npm test
# Test Suites: 7 passed, 7 total
# Tests: 78 passed, 78 total
```

### HTTP Server Tests
✅ Server starts correctly
```bash
PORT=1937 N8N_HOST=example.up.railway.app node build/main.cjs
# Output: N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server v0.10.3 running on port 1937
```

✅ Health endpoint works
```bash
curl http://localhost:1937/health
# Output: {"status":"healthy","service":"n8n-workflow-builder",...}
```

✅ URL normalization works
```bash
# Input: N8N_HOST=example.up.railway.app
# Normalized to: https://example.up.railway.app
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Click Deploy Button:**
   - Use the "Deploy on Railway" button in README.md
   - Choose PostgreSQL or MySQL template

2. **Set Required Variables:**
   - Database password
   - N8N admin password
   - N8N API key (generate after n8n deploys)

3. **Wait for Services to Deploy:**
   - PostgreSQL/MySQL → N8N → Workflow Builder
   - Check each service becomes "Active"

4. **Generate API Key:**
   - Open N8N UI
   - Go to Settings → API
   - Create API key
   - Add to workflow-builder environment

5. **Test Deployment:**
   - Visit workflow-builder `/health` endpoint
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

### Manual Deploy

See [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) for detailed manual deployment steps.

## Common Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "Application failed to respond" (PORT Configuration)
**Cause:** Documentation instructed users to manually set PORT=1937, which overrides Railway's automatic PORT assignment. Railway assigns a dynamic port and expects the application to bind to that port for routing and health checks.
**Fix:** Removed PORT=1937 from all deployment documentation and Railway templates. Railway now automatically manages the PORT variable, while the application code correctly defaults to 1937 for local development.
**Impact:** This is the most common deployment failure. The application must use Railway's assigned PORT for proper routing.

### Issue 2: Missing nixpacks.toml configuration
**Cause:** Missing nixpacks.toml configuration
**Fix:** Added nixpacks.toml with explicit build phases

### Issue 3: Can't connect to N8N
**Cause:** N8N_HOST missing https:// prefix
**Fix:** Added URL normalization function

### Issue 4: Build fails on Railway
**Cause:** Incorrect builder configuration in railway.toml
**Fix:** Changed to `builder = "NIXPACKS"` (uppercase)

### Issue 5: Health check timeout
**Cause:** Health check configuration issues
**Fix:** Set explicit healthcheckPath and timeout in railway.toml

## Verification Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Workflow-builder service shows "Active" status
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 status
- [ ] Logs show: "N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server v0.10.3 running on port [Railway-assigned-port]"
- [ ] N8N_HOST is normalized with https:// prefix
- [ ] Can access workflow-builder public URL
- [ ] Root endpoint shows server information
- [ ] **DO NOT** see PORT=1937 in Railway environment variables (Railway manages PORT automatically)

   - Follow the checklist
   - **DO NOT manually set the PORT variable** - let Railway manage it

2. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Verify health endpoint
   - Test workflow operations
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify the application is running on Railway's assigned port

3. **Monitor:**
   - Watch Railway metrics
   - Check for errors in logs
   - Verify API calls work

4. **Configure Backups:**
   - Enable database backups
   - Document API keys securely

## Support

If issues persist:

1. Check Railway build logs
2. Check service logs in Railway dashboard
3. Review environment variables
4. Verify service dependencies
5. Check [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
6. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
7. Open GitHub issue with logs and configuration

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ✅ All 3 services (Database, N8N, Workflow Builder) are "Active"
- ✅ Health endpoint returns `{"status":"healthy"}`
- ✅ Logs show server running on correct port
- ✅ N8N_HOST is properly formatted with https://
- ✅ Can create and execute workflows via API
