# üîß Troubleshooting Guide for n8n Workflow Builder MCP Server

**Comprehensive solutions for common issues when connecting AI assistants to n8n workflows.**

## üö® Quick Diagnostic Commands

Before diving into specific issues, try these diagnostic commands with your AI assistant:

```
"Test my n8n connection"
"Show me the server status"
"List my workflows" (basic connectivity test)
"What's my n8n instance information?"
```

## üîå Connection Issues

### "Connection Refused" or "ECONNREFUSED"

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot connect to n8n instance
- Timeout errors when trying to list workflows
- "Network unreachable" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify n8n Instance is Running**
   ```bash
   # Check if n8n is accessible
   curl -I https://your-n8n-instance.com
   ```

2. **Check N8N_HOST Configuration**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `https://your-n8n.com`
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `http://localhost:5678`
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `your-n8n.com` (missing protocol)
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `https://your-n8n.com/` (trailing slash)

3. **Network Connectivity**
   - Test from browser: Visit your n8n instance URL
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify VPN/proxy configuration

4. **Port Configuration**
   - Default n8n port: 5678
   - n8n Cloud: Use full HTTPS URL
   - Self-hosted: Include custom port if different

**AI Assistant Command to Test:**
```
"Check if my n8n instance at [your-url] is accessible"
```

### "Unauthorized" or "401 Authentication Error"

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid API key" messages
- "Unauthorized access" errors
- Can connect but cannot perform actions

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify API Key Format**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `n8n_api_1234567890abcdef...`
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Missing `n8n_api_` prefix
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Truncated or incomplete key

2. **Check API Key Permissions**
   - Ensure key has workflow management permissions
   - Verify key hasn't expired
   - Test key with direct API call:
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: your-api-key" https://your-n8n.com/api/v1/workflows
   ```

3. **Regenerate API Key**
   - Go to n8n Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Delete old key and create new one
   - Update MCP server configuration

**AI Assistant Command to Test:**
```
"Verify my n8n API key permissions"
```

### "Workflow Not Found" or "404 Error"

**Symptoms:**
- Specific workflows cannot be accessed
- "Workflow ID does not exist" messages
- Some workflows visible, others not

**Solutions:**

1. **List All Workflows First**
   ```
   "List all my n8n workflows with their IDs"
   ```

2. **Check Workflow ID Format**
   - Use exact ID from workflow list
   - IDs are typically numeric or UUID format
   - Case-sensitive in some configurations

3. **Verify Workflow Permissions**
   - Ensure API key has access to specific workflows
   - Check if workflow is in different project/workspace

## üöÄ Installation and Setup Issues

### "Server Won't Start" or "Module Not Found"

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server fails to launch
- "Cannot find module" errors
- "Command not found" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Node.js Version**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Must be 18.0.0 or higher
   ```

2. **Clear npm Cache**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Reinstall Package**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @makafeli/n8n-workflow-builder
   npm install -g @makafeli/n8n-workflow-builder
   ```

4. **Use NPX Instead**
   ```bash
   npx @makafeli/n8n-workflow-builder
   ```

### "Permission Denied" Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot install package globally
- "EACCES" permission errors
- Installation fails with permission issues

**Solutions:**

1. **Use NPX (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   npx @makafeli/n8n-workflow-builder
   ```

2. **Fix npm Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Configure npm to use different directory
   mkdir ~/.npm-global
   npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
   echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Use Node Version Manager**
   ```bash
   # Install nvm and use it to manage Node.js
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   ```
