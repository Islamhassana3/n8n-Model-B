# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Complete Debug Summary

## 📋 Problem Statement
The application was failing with "Application failed to respond" error when deployed to Railway at:
`https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/`

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Build Directory**
- The build directory wasn't being created during deployment
- Railway was trying to run `node build/main.cjs` but files didn't exist

### 2. **HTTP Mode Not Enabled**
- The application needs `USE_HTTP=true` to run in HTTP server mode
- Without this, it runs in stdio mode (for MCP CLI usage)

### 3. **Build Process Not Configured**
- Railway wasn't running the TypeScript compilation step
- The `npm run build` command wasn't being executed

### 4. **Environment Variables Missing**
- `USE_HTTP` wasn't set in deployment environment
- `NODE_ENV` wasn't set to production

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Files Modified/Created:

#### 1. **`nixpacks.toml`** (Updated)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm ci --legacy-peer-deps"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "USE_HTTP=true node build/main.cjs"  # ✅ Forces HTTP mode

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

#### 2. **`railway.toml`** (Simplified)
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3
```

#### 3. **`Procfile`** (New - Backup Configuration)
```
web: USE_HTTP=true node build/main.cjs
```

#### 4. **`.railwayignore`** (New - Optimization)
```
node_modules
.git
.env
tests
test-results
*.md
*.log
.vscode
.github
```

#### 5. **`scripts/check-railway-deployment.sh`** (New - Verification Tool)
- Health check verification script
- Tests `/health` and `/` endpoints
- Provides deployment status

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Railway receives push** → GitHub webhook triggers deployment
2. **Nixpacks builds** → Runs `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
3. **TypeScript compiles** → Runs `npm run build` → Creates `build/` directory
4. **Server starts** → Runs `USE_HTTP=true node build/main.cjs`
5. **Health check** → Railway checks `/health` endpoint
6. **Live!** → Application responds on assigned PORT

### Application Startup:
```bash
Starting N8N Workflow Builder in HTTP mode...
N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server v0.10.3 running on port [Railway's PORT]
Health check: http://localhost:[PORT]/health
MCP endpoint: http://localhost:[PORT]/mcp
Modern SDK 1.17.0 with HTTP transport and 23 tools available
```

## 📦 Git Commits

### Commit 1: `db0249f`
- Fixed railway.toml with build command
- Added .railwayignore
- Added USE_HTTP environment variable

### Commit 2: `41b6bb4` ✅ **CURRENT**
- Updated nixpacks.toml with USE_HTTP in start command
- Simplified railway.toml
- Added Procfile as backup
- Created deployment verification script
- Added comprehensive documentation

## 🧪 Local Testing Results

```bash
✅ Build successful: npm run build
✅ Server starts: PORT=3000 USE_HTTP=true node build/main.cjs
✅ Health check: curl http://localhost:3000/health → 200 OK
✅ Root endpoint: curl http://localhost:3000/ → 200 OK
```

## 🌐 Expected Endpoints

Once deployed, these endpoints should work:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Welcome page with service info |
| `/health` | GET | Health check (JSON response) |
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP protocol endpoint |
| `/copilot-panel` | GET | AI Copilot UI (if OPENAI_API_KEY set) |

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Currently Auto-Set:
- ✅ `USE_HTTP=true` (via nixpacks.toml)
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production` (via nixpacks.toml)
- ✅ `PORT` (Railway auto-assigns)

### Optional (Set in Railway Dashboard):
- `N8N_HOST` - Your n8n instance URL
- `N8N_API_KEY` - Your n8n API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI Copilot features
- `COPILOT_ENABLED=true` - Enable Copilot panel

## 📊 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
- Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
- Find your `n8n-workflow-builder` service
- Check "Deployments" tab for build logs
- Verify deployment status is "Success"

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "n8n-workflow-builder",
  "version": "0.10.3",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T..."
}
```

### 3. Test Root Endpoint
```bash
curl https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/
```
Should return HTML welcome page

### 4. Run Verification Script
```bash
bash scripts/check-railway-deployment.sh
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 502:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Railway Dashboard → Deployments → View Logs
   - Look for TypeScript compilation errors
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Verify Environment**
   ```bash
   # In Railway logs, look for:
   Starting N8N Workflow Builder in HTTP mode...
   N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server v0.10.3 running on port XXXX
   ```

3. **Check Port Binding**
   - App must bind to `0.0.0.0` (✅ Already configured)
   - App must use `process.env.PORT` (✅ Already configured)

4. **Restart Deployment**
   - Railway Dashboard → Deployments → Redeploy

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails | Check Node version (needs >= 18.0.0) |
| Import errors | Build script auto-fixes these |
| Port timeout | Increase healthcheckTimeout in railway.toml |
| 502 after build | Check logs for runtime errors |

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Wait for Deployment** (2-3 minutes)
   - Railway is building from latest commit
   - Watch deployment logs in Railway dashboard

2. 🧪 **Test Endpoints**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/check-railway-deployment.sh
   ```

3. ⚙️ **Configure Environment** (Optional)
   - Add N8N_HOST if connecting to n8n instance
   - Add N8N_API_KEY for authentication
   - Add OPENAI_API_KEY for AI features

4. 📊 **Monitor Logs**
   - Check Railway logs for any errors
   - Verify health checks are passing
   - Monitor resource usage

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Server starts on Railway's PORT
- ✅ Health check returns 200 OK
- ✅ Root endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ No 502 errors
- ✅ Logs show "HTTP Server running"
