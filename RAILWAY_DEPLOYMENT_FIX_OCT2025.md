# Railway Deployment Fix - October 1, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Build Directory**
- **Problem**: Railway was trying to run `node build/main.cjs` but the build directory didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated `railway.toml` to include `npm run build` in the start command

### 2. **HTTP Mode Not Enabled**
- **Problem**: The app wasn't running in HTTP mode, which is required for Railway
- **Solution**: Added `USE_HTTP=true` environment variable in `railway.toml`

### 3. **Health Check Configuration**
- **Problem**: Railway expects a `/health` endpoint to verify the app is running
- **Solution**: Confirmed health check endpoint exists at `/health` and configured in `railway.toml`

### 4. **Port Binding**
- **Problem**: App must listen on Railway's provided PORT
- **Solution**: App already correctly uses `process.env.PORT` and binds to `0.0.0.0`

## 📋 Changes Made

### `railway.toml`
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run build && node build/main.cjs"  # ✅ Build before running
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

# Environment variables for Railway deployment
[[deploy.environmentVariables]]
name = "USE_HTTP"
value = "true"  # ✅ Enable HTTP mode

[[deploy.environmentVariables]]
name = "NODE_ENV"
value = "production"
```

### `.railwayignore` (NEW FILE)
```
node_modules
.git
.env
tests
test-results
*.md
*.log
.vscode
.github
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Git Commit**: `db0249f`  
**Pushed to**: `main` branch  
**Deployment**: Should auto-deploy on Railway now

## 🔍 What Railway Will Do

1. Clone your repository
2. Run `npm install` (automatically via Nixpacks)
3. Run `npm run build` (from startCommand)
4. Start the server with `node build/main.cjs`
5. Health check at `https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/health`

## 📊 Expected Server Output

```
Starting N8N Workflow Builder in HTTP mode...
N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server
N8N API Configuration:
Host: http://localhost:5678
API Key: Not set
Port: [Railway's PORT]
Copilot Enabled: false
OpenAI Key Present: no
N8N Workflow Builder HTTP Server v0.10.3 running on port [Railway's PORT]
Health check: http://localhost:[Railway's PORT]/health
MCP endpoint: http://localhost:[Railway's PORT]/mcp
Modern SDK 1.17.0 with HTTP transport and 23 tools available
```

## 🔧 Railway Environment Variables to Set

If you need to connect to an n8n instance, set these in Railway dashboard:

1. **N8N_HOST** - Your n8n instance URL (e.g., `https://your-n8n.example.com`)
2. **N8N_API_KEY** - Your n8n API key
3. **OPENAI_API_KEY** (optional) - For AI Copilot features

## ✨ Available Endpoints

- **`/`** - Welcome page
- **`/health`** - Health check (returns JSON status)
- **`/mcp`** - MCP protocol endpoint (POST)
- **`/copilot-panel`** - AI Copilot UI (if OPENAI_API_KEY is set)

## 🧪 Local Testing

To test locally before deployment:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in HTTP mode
PORT=3000 USE_HTTP=true node build/main.cjs

# Test health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Railway Logs**: Check the deployment logs in Railway dashboard
2. **Test Health Endpoint**: Visit `https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/health`
3. **Test Main Page**: Visit `https://n8n-workflow-builder-production-8aa3.up.railway.app/`
4. **Set Environment Variables**: Add N8N_HOST and N8N_API_KEY if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Application failed to respond":

1. Check Railway logs for build errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the build command completed successfully
4. Check that port binding is to `0.0.0.0` not `localhost`

### Common Issues:

- **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (should be >= 18.0.0)
- **Import errors**: The build script fixes these automatically
- **Port conflicts**: Railway assigns a random port via `PORT` env var
- **Timeout**: Increase `healthcheckTimeout` in railway.toml

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Test locally with the same environment variables
4. Check Railway community forums
